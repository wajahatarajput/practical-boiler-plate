              question: 'If x < 0 (x is negative) and y > 0 (y is positive), what is the sign of the expression (x²y)/(−x)?',
              solution: 'Step 1: Analyze x². Since x is negative, x² = (negative) × (negative) = positive. Remember: any number squared is always positive, regardless of whether the original number was positive or negative. Step 2: Analyze x² × y. We have: positive × positive (since y > 0) = positive. So x²y is positive. Step 3: Analyze the division (x²y) ÷ (−x). We have: positive ÷ negative. Since −x means the negative of x, and x is negative, −x is positive. Wait, let\'s recalculate: if x < 0, then −x > 0. So we have: positive ÷ positive = positive. Actually, let\'s be more careful: (x²y)/(−x) = (positive × positive)/(positive) = positive/positive = positive. Step 4: Final answer. The sign of (x²y)/(−x) is positive.',
              explanation: 'This problem requires careful step-by-step analysis. First, x² is always positive (any number squared is positive). Then x² × y is positive × positive = positive. Finally, we divide by −x. Since x is negative, −x is positive. So positive ÷ positive = positive. The key insight is that x² is always positive, and we must carefully determine the sign of −x based on the fact that x is negative.',

Step 2: Apply sign rule for multiplication: negative × negative = positive. So (−3) × (−4) = +12. Step 3: Now we have: +12 ÷ (−2) × (−1). Perform the division next: +12 ÷ (−2). Step 4: Apply sign rule for division: positive ÷ negative = negative. So +12 ÷ (−2) = −6. Step 5: Now we have: −6 × (−1). Perform the final multiplication: negative × negative = positive. So −6 × (−1) = +6. Step 6: Final answer is +6 or simply 6.',
              explanation: 'When evaluating expressions with multiple operations, work from left to right.

After 3 hours, total drop = 3 × 5°C = 15°C. Step 3: Calculate final temperature. Starting: −10°C. Drop: −15°C (negative because it\'s a decrease). Final = −10 + (−15) = −25°C. Step 4: Verify with sign rules. Adding two negative numbers: negative + negative = more negative. So −10 + (−15) = −25. Therefore, the final temperature is −25°C.',

Each hour, the temperature decreases by 5°C, which we represent as −5°C. After 3 hours, the total decrease is 3 × (−5) = −15°C.

Step 2: Find the prime factorization of each number. For 24: 24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 2³ × 3. For 36: 36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 2² × 3². Step 3: Find the GCD using prime factors. GCD takes the lowest power of each common prime factor: GCD(24, 36) = 2² × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12. Step 4: Interpret the result. GCD(24, 36) = 12 means we can make 12 baskets. Step 5: Calculate items per basket. Apples per basket: 24 ÷ 12 = 2 apples. Oranges per basket: 36 ÷ 12 = 3 oranges. Step 6: Verify. Total apples: 12 baskets × 2 apples = 24 apples. ✓ Total oranges: 12 baskets × 3 oranges = 36 oranges. ✓ Therefore, the maximum number of baskets is 12, with each basket containing 2 apples and 3 oranges.',
              explanation: 'GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) finds the largest number that divides both numbers evenly. For distribution problems, GCD tells us the maximum number of equal groups we can make. We use prime factorization: take the lowest power of each common prime factor.

Step 2: Find the prime factorization of each number. For 2: 2 = 2 (prime). For 3: 3 = 3 (prime). For 4: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2². Step 3: Find the LCM using prime factors. LCM takes the highest power of each prime: LCM(2, 3, 4) = 2² × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12. Step 4: Interpret the result. LCM(2, 3, 4) = 12 means they will jog together again after 12 days.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 4x = 50 − 10 = 40. Divide both sides by 4: x = 40 ÷ 4 = 10. Step 6: Find both current ages. Mary\'s current age = x = 10 years.

In 20 years, father will be twice as old as son: 4x + 20 = 2(x + 20). Step 4: Expand the right side. 4x + 20 = 2x + 40. Step 5: Solve for x. Subtract 2x from both sides: 4x − 2x + 20 = 40, which gives: 2x + 20 = 40. Subtract 20 from both sides: 2x = 40 − 20 = 20. Divide both sides by 2: x = 20 ÷ 2 = 10. Step 6: Find both current ages.

Step 2: Determine ages 5 years ago. Five years ago, daughter was: x − 5 years old. Five years ago, mother was: (45 − x) − 5 = 40 − x years old. Step 3: Set up the equation from the past relationship. Five years ago, mother was 6 times as old as daughter: 40 − x = 6(x − 5). Step 4: Expand the right side. 40 − x = 6x − 30. Step 5: Solve for x. Add x to both sides: 40 = 6x + x − 30, which gives: 40 = 7x − 30. Add 30 to both sides: 40 + 30 = 7x, so 70 = 7x. Divide both sides by 7: x = 70 ÷ 7 = 10. Step 6: Find both current ages. Daughter\'s current age = x = 10 years. Mother\'s current age = 45 − x = 45 − 10 = 35 years. Step 7: Verify the answer. Current ages: Daughter = 10, Mother = 35.

              question: 'Two cars start 200 km apart and drive toward each other. Car A travels at 60 km/h and Car B travels at 80 km/h. How long will it take for them to meet?',
              solution: 'Step 1: Understand the situation. The cars are moving toward each other, so they are closing the distance between them. Step 2: Identify given information. Distance between starting points = 200 km. Car A speed = 60 km/h. Car B speed = 80 km/h. Step 3: Calculate relative speed. When objects move toward each other, we add their speeds: Relative speed = 60 + 80 = 140 km/h. This means they are closing the gap at 140 km per hour. Step 4: Use the formula: Time = Distance ÷ Rate. Time to meet = 200 km ÷ 140 km/h. Step 5: Calculate: 200 ÷ 140 = 200/140 = 20/14 = 10/7 hours. Step 6: Convert to decimal if needed: 10/7 ≈ 1.43 hours. Step 7: Convert to hours and minutes: 1.43 hours = 1 hour + 0.43 × 60 minutes = 1 hour 26 minutes (approximately). Therefore, they will meet in approximately 1 hour and 26 minutes.',
              explanation: 'When two objects move toward each other, their speeds combine to close the distance faster. We add the speeds to find how fast the gap between them is closing.

              solution: 'Step 1: Understand the situation. Both cars travel in the same direction, with Car B starting later but traveling faster. Step 2: Find Car A\'s head start. Car A starts at 9:00 AM, Car B starts at 10:00 AM. Time difference = 1 hour. In that 1 hour, Car A travels: Distance = Rate × Time = 50 km/h × 1 hour = 50 km. So Car A has a 50 km head start. Step 3: Calculate relative speed. Since they move in the same direction, we subtract speeds: Relative speed = 70 − 50 = 20 km/h. This means Car B closes the gap at 20 km per hour. Step 4: Find time for Car B to catch up. Time = Distance ÷ Rate = 50 km ÷ 20 km/h = 2.5 hours. Step 5: Calculate the meeting time. Car B starts at 10:00 AM. After 2.5 hours: 10:00 AM + 2 hours 30 minutes = 12:30 PM. Therefore, Car B will catch up to Car A at 12:30 PM. Step 6: Verify. At 12:30 PM: Car A has been traveling for 3.5 hours: 50 × 3.5 = 175 km. Car B has been traveling for 2.5 hours: 70 × 2.5 = 175 km. Both are at the same distance! ✓',
              explanation: 'This is a "catching up" problem. The key steps are: (1) Calculate the head start distance that the first car gains, (2) Find the relative speed (difference in speeds when going same direction), (3) Use Time = Distance ÷ Rate to find catch-up time, (4) Add this time to the later start time.

              question: 'A train travels 300 km at a constant speed. If it had traveled 10 km/h faster, it would have taken 1 hour less. What was the original speed of the train?',
              solution: 'Step 1: Define variables. Let the original speed = r km/h. Let the original time = t hours. Step 2: Set up the first equation from the original trip. Using d = rt: 300 = r × t. This gives us: t = 300/r. Step 3: Set up the second scenario. New speed = (r + 10) km/h. New time = (t − 1) hours (1 hour less). Step 4: Set up the second equation. Using d = rt for the new scenario: 300 = (r + 10) × (t − 1). Step 5: Substitute t from step 2. 300 = (r + 10) × (300/r − 1). Step 6: Expand and simplify. 300 = (r + 10) × (300/r − 1) = (r + 10) × (300 − r)/r = (r + 10)(300 − r)/r. Step 7: Multiply both sides by r. 300r = (r + 10)(300 − r). Step 8: Expand the right side. 300r = 300r − r² + 3000 − 10r = 290r − r² + 3000. Step 9: Rearrange to form quadratic equation. Subtract 300r from both sides: 0 = 290r − r² + 3000 − 300r = −r² − 10r + 3000. Multiply by −1: r² + 10r − 3000 = 0. Step 10: Solve the quadratic equation. Factor: (r + 60)(r − 50) = 0. So r = −60 (reject, speed cannot be negative) or r = 50. Step 11: Final answer. The original speed was 50 km/h. Step 12: Verify. Original: 300 km ÷ 50 km/h = 6 hours. New: 300 km ÷ 60 km/h = 5 hours. Difference = 1 hour. ✓ Correct!',
              explanation: 'This problem requires setting up two equations based on the distance-rate-time relationship. We use the fact that distance is constant (300 km) but speed and time change. The key is to express time in terms of speed, then set up an equation comparing the two scenarios. This leads to a quadratic equation that we solve to find the original speed.',

              question: 'A boat travels 24 km upstream (against the current) in 4 hours and the same distance downstream (with the current) in 3 hours. What is the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the current?',
              solution: 'Step 1: Define variables. Let boat speed in still water = b km/h. Let current speed = c km/h. Step 2: Understand effective speeds. Upstream (against current): Effective speed = b − c (current slows the boat). Downstream (with current): Effective speed = b + c (current helps the boat). Step 3: Set up upstream equation. Distance = 24 km, Time = 4 hours, Speed = (b − c) km/h. Using d = rt: 24 = (b − c) × 4. Divide both sides by 4: b − c = 24 ÷ 4 = 6. So: b − c = 6. (Equation 1) Step 4: Set up downstream equation. Distance = 24 km, Time = 3 hours, Speed = (b + c) km/h. Using d = rt: 24 = (b + c) × 3. Divide both sides by 3: b + c = 24 ÷ 3 = 8. So: b + c = 8. (Equation 2) Step 5: Solve the system of equations. Add Equation 1 and Equation 2: (b − c) + (b + c) = 6 + 8. This gives: 2b = 14, so b = 7 km/h. Step 6: Find current speed. Substitute b = 7 into Equation 2: 7 + c = 8, so c = 8 − 7 = 1 km/h. Step 7: Verify. Upstream: (7 − 1) × 4 = 6 × 4 = 24 km. ✓ Downstream: (7 + 1) × 3 = 8 × 3 = 24 km. ✓ Correct! Therefore, boat speed in still water = 7 km/h, current speed = 1 km/h.',
              explanation: 'This is a classic upstream/downstream problem. The key is understanding that the current affects the boat\'s effective speed: subtract current speed when going upstream, add when going downstream. We set up two equations using the distance-rate-time formula, then solve the system to find both the boat speed and current speed. Always verify by checking both scenarios.',
